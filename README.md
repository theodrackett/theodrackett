### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m constangly working on improving myself. I had a job in college at a manufacturing company. Everyday they would instill in us, the Japanese work KAIZEN. It means continuous improvement. Needless to say, I have been inductrinated.

ðŸ‘¯ I love learning new technologies and would love to collaborate on anything new and exciting using my favorite language, Python or Java.

âš¡ Fun fact: yawdie means Jamaican in patios (the Jamaican language).
